    <h1>Rewards Technique for Team Motivation - MCQ</h1>
    <div class="question" id="q1">
        <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> In a software development team, the manager notices that developers are working overtime to meet deadlines but seem disengaged. To boost motivation, the manager decides to implement a reward system. Which approach is most likely to enhance intrinsic motivation?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="a"> a) Offer a cash bonus for meeting deadlines.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="b"> b) Provide public recognition for creative solutions during team meetings.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="c"> c) Give gift cards to the fastest coders.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="d"> d) Increase overtime pay rates.</label>
        </div>
        <button class="answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1')">Show Answer</button>
        <div class="answer" id="answer1">
            <p><strong>Correct Answer: b)</strong> Provide public recognition for creative solutions during team meetings.</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Intrinsic motivation stems from internal satisfaction, such as feeling valued or accomplished. Public recognition for creative solutions acknowledges individual contributions and fosters a sense of purpose, enhancing intrinsic motivation. Options a), c), and d) are extrinsic rewards (monetary or tangible), which may boost short-term performance but are less effective for sustaining long-term engagement.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="question" id="q2">
        <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> A sales team exceeds its quarterly targets, and the manager wants to reward them. However, the budget is limited. What is the most cost-effective reward that still motivates the team?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="a"> a) A team outing to an expensive restaurant.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="b"> b) A personalized thank-you note from the CEO.</label>

        <div class="answer" id="answer2">
            <p><strong>Correct Answer: b)</strong> A personalized thank-you note from the CEO.</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Non-monetary rewards like personalized thank-you notes are highly cost-effective and can significantly boost morale by making employees feel appreciated. Options a), c), and d) involve higher costs and may not be as impactful for long-term motivation, especially if the team values recognition over material rewards.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

            <p><strong>Correct Answer: b)</strong> Offer a team-based reward, like a group outing, if the campaign succeeds.</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Team-based rewards encourage collaboration by aligning individual efforts toward a collective goal.

        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question" id="q4">

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Timely rewards reinforce positive behavior and maintain motivation. Immediate recognition after milestones keeps the team engaged throughout the project.

        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question" id="q5">
        <p><strong>Question 5:</strong> An employee in a customer service team prefers flexible work hours over monetary rewards. How should the manager incorporate this preference into the reward system?</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Personalizing rewards to match individual preferences increases their effectiveness.

    </div>
