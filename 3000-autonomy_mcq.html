    <h1>Autonomy in Team Motivation - MCQ Test</h1>

    <div class="question" id="q1">
        <h3>1. A software development team is working on a new project. The manager assigns tasks but allows team members to choose their preferred programming tools and methodologies. How does this approach impact team motivation?</h3>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="a"> a) It reduces motivation due to lack of clear direction.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="b"> b) It increases motivation by fostering ownership and creativity.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="c"> c) It has no impact on motivation.</label>

            <strong>Correct Answer: b) It increases motivation by fostering ownership and creativity.</strong><br>
            Allowing team members to choose their tools and methodologies gives them autonomy, which enhances their sense of ownership and encourages creative problem-solving. This aligns with autonomy as a key motivator in self-determination theory, boosting engagement and productivity.

    <div class="question" id="q2">
        <h3>2. In a marketing team, employees are given the freedom to design their own campaign strategies but must meet specific performance goals. What is the primary benefit of this autonomy?</h3>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="a"> a) It ensures all campaigns are uniform.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="b"> b) It encourages innovative and tailored solutions.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="c"> c) It reduces the need for managerial oversight.</label>

            <strong>Correct Answer: b) It encourages innovative and tailored solutions.</strong><br>
            Autonomy in designing campaign strategies allows team members to leverage their unique insights and creativity, leading to innovative and effective campaigns. This freedom within defined goals fosters motivation by giving employees control over their work process.

    <div class="question" id="q3">
        <h3>3. A manager notices that team morale is low due to micromanagement. What autonomy-based strategy could improve motivation?</h3>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="a"> a) Assign detailed step-by-step tasks to each member.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="b"> b) Allow team members to set their own deadlines within project constraints.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="c"> c) Increase supervision to ensure quality.</label>

        </div>
        <button class="explanation-button" onclick="toggleExplanation('exp3')">Show Explanation</button>

            <strong>Correct Answer: b) Allow team members to set their own deadlines within project constraints.</strong><br>
            Micromanagement often reduces motivation by limiting autonomy. Allowing team members to set their own deadlines within constraints empowers them, increases accountability, and boosts morale by trusting their judgment, aligning with autonomy's role in motivation.

    </div>

    <div class="question" id="q4">
        <h3>4. A sales team is allowed to decide how to approach clients but must follow a strict script during pitches. How does this balance of autonomy affect motivation?</h3>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="a"> a) It fully maximizes motivation through complete autonomy.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="b"> b) It may limit motivation due to restricted creativity in pitches.</label>

            <strong>Correct Answer: b) It may limit motivation due to restricted creativity in pitches.</strong><br>
            While autonomy in approaching clients is motivating, a strict script during pitches limits creative expression, which can reduce motivation. Autonomy is most effective when employees have meaningful control over key aspects of their work.
